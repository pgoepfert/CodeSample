	<h1>History &amp; ByLaws</h1>
	<p>The Scottsdale Model Flyers have been functioning at Scottsdale Community College for 40 years. We are an AMA certified club with over 120 members. We support and accommodate all types of model aviation such as electric park Flyers, helicopters, airplanes both Nitro and Gas including giant scale and Pattern aircraft. Unfortunately, we are not an approved flying site for turbine jet aircraft. Most of our flying is sport flying, fun fly&#8217;s, and Community support functions. Overall our key to success over the years has been maintaining a friendly atmosphere, a focus on safety at all times &#38; helping others, and supporting College requirements whenever requested. Our club By-laws are included here as a reference to our organization, structure and operational considerations.</p>
